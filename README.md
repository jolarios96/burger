# burger

This is an app deployed on Heroku that makes use of MySQL.

# Usage:
 - Submit an ingredient name to turn it into a burger!
 - Click "EAT IT" to move the burger into your stomache.
 - You can click "Reorder!" to order another of the same burger (The burger will not disappear).
 - By clicking "Return" or "Digest!", you can delete the burger from either list.

# TODO:
 - The UI is currently very basic, and I am planning to update it more in the future.
 - Will add pictures to readme once that is done.
